Hello, Welcome to our space game!
Hey there explorer! Welcome to the game, here is a small tutorial to run you through the basics of the game! 
The game: You need to assemble a crew to help you in your space adventure before your time runs out!. Your ticket home is to find the spaceship parts hidden around this solar system. But first, you must set how much time (in days) you want to play this game for! 0.This will also show how many spaceship parts hidden around the solar system there is (this changes based on the days). Please continue and keep checking in!

Character Selection
So you've picked your time limit eh? Now it's time to pick the team that'll help you complete your adventure before the time is up, choose wisely as each team member has a cool special ability unique to each type of team member! You may also choose multiple types. Don't forget to click on each crew member to read up about them and their abilities. Make sure to cycle through each crew member when naming them.

Choose and name your ship
This team you've got looks awesome, Let's hope they get along. Now it's time to choose and name the ship that you'll be spending your time in! Make sure to check your team (on the left) and make sure everything is as you picked it. The different ships are purely cosmetic, and the different options don't change the gameplay, only your physical ship disguise, choose what one you think looks cool! Then it's time to play the game! Buckle up and brief your team.

Home/Main screen
Here's your spaceship! Get used to it because it's all yours. The rules of the game are simple. Find all of the spaceship parts before your time runs out or all your crew dies! Each crew member has 2 action abilities. Use them wisely, because the only way to get another two is by going to the next day

Space Outpost Screen
Welcome to the Outpost! You'll always be able to come here no matter where your crew is exploring. Come by to stock up on various medical and food items, and maybe some extra special items in the convenience store. Make sure to buy what you need, as buying from the Outpost does NOT cost action abilities. 

Inventory Screen
Here you can see the items you've picked up and/or bought from the Space Outpost. Select an item and apply it to your selected crew member, single use only and it only works on 1 crew member! Applying items to a crew member does NOT cost action abilities.

Travel to a new planet
Found the spaceship part on your current planet? Or just getting bored? No problem. You need two members each with 1 action ability remaining, to successfully pilot your ship to the next planet (this will cost both players 1 action)

Going to next day
The only way to gain actions back for free is to go to the next day. This brings the days you have to win the game down, but will give every member a fresh 2 actions. You should only go to the next day when all members have 0 turns left.
